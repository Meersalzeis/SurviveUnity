Survive (or maybe titled 12 seconds 3 seconds, I'm not sure yet) is a hypercasual mobile game with a challenging bullethell game without enemies.
Yes, the only gameplay is to dodge, but its still exciting to play. Don't ask me how.

This project is currently in development and actively used as a "playground and test chamber".
To experiment with different ways of script communication (singletons, events, Scriptable Architecture).

The game is also used to experiment with folder structure by objects and their abstractions instead of the nature of the contents.

Same goes for coding conventions.

I will later (and on the fly) look which solution is best (for the given purpose), this means the project is intended to be rewritten to get more experience as to WHY.

Please keep this in mind when condemming this work for bad practice.
